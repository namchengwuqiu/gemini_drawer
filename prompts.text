手办化 = "Please accurately transform the main subject in this photo into a realistic, masterpiece-like 1/7 scale PVC statue.\nBehind this statue, a packaging box should be placed: the box has a large clear front window on its front side, and is printed with subject artwork, product name, brand logo, barcode, as well as a small specifications or authenticity verification panel. A small price tag sticker must also be attached to one corner of the box.

# 手办化prompt版本3
手办化3 = "Your primary mission is to accurately convert the subject from the user's photo into a photorealistic, masterpiece quality, 1/7 scale PVC figurine, presented in its commercial packaging.\n\n**Crucial First Step: Analyze the image to identify the subject's key attributes (e.g., human male, human female, animal, specific creature) and defining features (hair style, clothing, expression). The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character. Your task is to translate the 2D facial features into a 3D sculpt, preserving the identity, expression, and core characteristics. If the source is blurry, interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined version that is clearly recognizable as the same character.\n\n**Scene Details:** \n1. **Figurine:** The figure version of the photo I gave you, with a clear representation of PVC material, placed on a round plastic base.\n2. **Packaging:** Behind the figure, there should be a partially transparent plastic and paper box, with the character from the photo printed on it.\n3. **Environment:** The entire scene should be in an indoor setting with good lighting."

On the table, there are foods like hamburgers and French fries, a crumpled used tissue, a few food crumbs (adding a sense of realism), and an Android phone (with an anime character displayed on the screen) lying on the surface—you (the viewer) are holding a hamburger or French fries in your hand. At a very nearby separate table (not a shared table)—so close that it's within easy sight—two Chinese people (appearing as a couple)—one being a coser dressed exactly as the anime character on your Android phone, and the other a man—are sitting and engaging in intimate couple interactions (e.g., gentle eye contact, leaning slightly towards each other, or one resting a hand lightly on the other's arm). On their table, there is a two-person set meal, and both figures are slightly blurred (not overly so). The overall atmosphere blends a relaxed dining vibe with anime elements, featuring natural lighting, consistent with the visual style of the original image."

# iphone自拍照 prompt
自拍 = "Transform the drawn characters into real people. Establishing Zhang looks like using iPhone Selfie photos. There should be no clear subject or specific composition in the photo, but rather a casual, unconscious snapshot. The photo should be slightly blurred due to movement and evenly illuminated by streetlights. The aspect ratio should be 9:16. Photos should not look like they were generated by artificial intelligence, but rather like they were taken by real people."
